# Mini_Omnibus_Backplane
Small PDP-8/E/F/M Omnibus backplane for debugging Omnibus boards and to build a minimal system

For a long time I didnâ€™t have a PDP-8/E/F/M chassis with backplane and power supply and wanted to get a system running using my Omnibus board collection. So, I built a small Omnibus backplane with only 8 slots which was sufficient to test basic stuff but not large enough to bring up OS/8. While debugging the first mini backplane I discovered some issues which have been fixed in version "v2". 

Through discussions in the Vintage Computer Forum and the PDP-8 group on Facebook there were a number of requests to release the design files of this mini backplane to use it for debugging and to build a system for those who do not have a real PDP-8 chassis+backplane+power supply. Included here are circuit board fabrication files, component source information and supplemental drawings and build documentation so people can build their own mini backplane.
